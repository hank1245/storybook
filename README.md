# Storybook Effects Lab

I have always been fascinated by animations and visual effects. Whenever I spot an inspiring experiment or tutorial online, I recreate it to understand the underlying logic. This repository is my evolving playground: a Storybook-powered gallery where I explore those ideas, iterate on the interactions, and translate HTML/SCSS snippets into reusable React components styled with Styled Components.

Storybook might be best known for design systems, but its controls and preview add-ons make it a great canvas for showcasing motion. Each effect lives in its own story, letting me tweak props on the fly, try out thematic variations, and compare different implementations side by side. The collection is still small, yet I hope it grows into a creative hub of effects that other developers and designers can browse, remix, and drop into their own work.

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite for building the component playground
- Storybook for the interactive documentation environment
- Styled Components to encapsulate the visual logic of each effect

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook
```

The Storybook server opens automatically; explore the available controls to experiment with timings, colors, and other effect parameters.

## Roadmap

- Convert more HTML/SCSS motion studies into composable React components
- Expand the catalog with variations on existing effects instead of one-off demos
- Document reusable patterns, caveats, and performance tips as the library grows

If you are experimenting with a similar effect or have ideas for refinements, feel free to open an issue or share a story.
